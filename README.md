# Generative AI:

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data.

The creative power of Generative AI comes from a specific type of neural network called a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

A large language model (LLM) is a deep learning algorithm that can perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Large language models use transformer models and are trained using massive datasets â€” hence, large. This enables them to recognize, translate, predict, or generate text or other content.
