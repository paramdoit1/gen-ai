# Machine Learning Concepts:

## regression vs classification

Both regression and classification are supervised learning algorithms. Both the algorithms are used for prediction in machine learning and work with labeled datasets.


Main difference is regression algorithms are used to predict the continuous values.
Eg. price, salary, age, height etc.,

Classification algorithms are used to classify discrete values like Male/Female, True/False, spam/not spam etc.,

### Classification:

Classification is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the datasets into classes based on different parameters. In classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on training, it categorizes the data into different classes.

#### Example:
Email Spam detection. The model is trained on basis of millions of emails on different parameters, and whenever it receives a new email, it identifies whether the email is spam or not. If email is spam it gets moved to spam folder.

##### Classification Algorithms:
 * Logistic Regression
 * K-Nearest neighbours
 * Support Vector machines
 * Native Bayes 
 * Decision Tree
 * Random Forest

 ### Regression:
 Process of finding correlations between dependent and independent variables. It helps in predicting the continuous output variable y based the input varible x.

 ### Use cases
 * Predicting future weather based on the model
 * Predicting house prices

 #### Regression algorithms:

 * Simple Linear regression
 * Multiple linear regression
 * Support vector regression
 * Decision Tree Regression
 * Random Forest regression
