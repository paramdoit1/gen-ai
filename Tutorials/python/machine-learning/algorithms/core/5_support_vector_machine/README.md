# Support Vector Machine Algorithm:

Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.

The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.

SVM chooses the extreme points/vectors that help in creating the hyperplane. These extreme cases are called as support vectors, and hence algorithm is termed as Support Vector Machine. Consider the below diagram in which there are two different categories that are classified using a decision boundary or hyperplane:

The dimension of the hyperplane depends on the number of features. For instance, if there are two input features, the hyperplane is simply a line, and if there are three input features, the hyperplane becomes a 2-D plane. As the number of features increases beyond three, the complexity of visualizing the hyperplane also increases.

## Applications

### Image Classification
One of the most common applications of SVMs is in image classification. In this use case, the SVM algorithm is trained on a set of labeled images. The algorithm then uses this training data to classify new images. SVMs have been used for everything from recognizing faces in photographs to detecting tumors in medical images.

### Email Classification:
SVMs have been used to classify email as spam or not spam. In this application, the SVM algorithm is trained on a set of emails that are labeled as spam or not spam. The algorithm then uses this training data to classify new emails.

### Fraud Detection:

SVMs have been used to detect credit card fraud. The SVM algorithm is trained on a set of credit card transactions that are labeled as fraudulent or not fraudulent. The algorithm then uses this training data to detect new fraudulent transactions.
