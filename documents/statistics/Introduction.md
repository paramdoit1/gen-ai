# Statistics
Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. As a discipline it is concerned with the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, as well as the effective communication and presentation of results relying on data.

Statistics is used to measure, analyse the vaiability. The variables includes people height, weight, food preference, hair color and so on. It varies based on the region and the people.

# Types of Statistics:

## Descriptive:
Descriptive statistics uses data that provides a description of the population either through numerical calculated graphs or tables. It provides a graphical summary of data.

Descriptive statistics is a way to organise, represent and describe a collection of data using tables, graphs, and summary measures. For example, the collection of people in a city using the internet or using Television.

The data is summarised through the given observations. The summarisation is one from a sample of population using parameters such as the mean or standard deviation.

Descriptive statistics are also categorised into four different categories:

* Measure of frequency
* Measure of dispersion
* Measure of central tendency
* Measure of position

### Measure of Central Tendency
Measure of central tendency is also known as summary statistics that are used to represent the center point or a particular value of a data set or sample set. In statistics, there are three common measures of central tendency that are,

* Mean
* Median
* Mode

#### Mean
It is the measure of the average of all values in a sample set. The mean of the data set is calculated using the formula,
```
    Mean = ∑x/n
```

#### Median
It is the measure of the central value of a sample set. In these, the data set is ordered from lowest to highest value and then finds the exact middle. The formula used to calculate the median of the data set is, suppose we are given ‘n’ terms in s data set,

If n is Even

```
Median = [(n/2)th term + (n/2 + 1)th term]/2
```

If n is Odd

```
Median = (n + 1)/2
```

#### Mode
It is the value most frequently arrived in the sample set. The value repeated most of the time in the central set is actually mode. The mode of the data set is calculated using the formula,

```
Mode = Term with Highest Frequency
```
### Measure of Variability
The measure of Variability is also known as the measure of dispersion and is used to describe variability in a sample or population. In statistics, there are three common measures of variability as shown below:

####  Range of Data
It is a given measure of how to spread apart values in a sample set or data set.

```
Range = Maximum value – Minimum value
```

#### Variance
Variance describes how much a random variable defers from the expected value and it is also computed as a square of deviation.

```
S2= ∑ni=1 [(xi – ͞x)2 / n]

n represents total data points
͞x represents the mean of data points
xi represents individual data points
```

## Inferential Statistics:

Inferential Statistics makes inferences and predictions about the population based on a sample of data taken from the population. It generalizes a large dataset and applies probabilities to draw a conclusion.

Inferential statistics are generally used to determine how strong a relationship is within the sample. However, it is very difficult to obtain a population list and draw a random sample. Inferential statistics can be done with the help of various steps as given below:

### Types of Inferential Statistics
Various types of inferential statistics are used widely nowadays and are very easy to interpret.
* T-test or Anova
* Confidence Interval
* Pearson Correlation
* Bivariate Regression
* Multi-variate Regression

## Variables:
A variable is a characteristic that can be measured and that can assume different values. 

Height, age, income, province or country of birth, grades obtained at school and type of housing are all examples of variables.

Variables may be classified into two main categories: categorical and numeric.

Each category is then classified in two subcategories: nominal or ordinal for categorical variables, discrete or continuous for numeric variables.

### Nominal variables
A nominal variable is one that describes a name, label or category without natural order. Gender and type of dwelling are examples of nominal variables. The variable “mode of transportation for travel to work” is also nominal.

### Ordinal variables
An ordinal variable is a variable whose values are defined by an order relation between the different categories. 
The variable “behaviour” is ordinal because the category “Excellent” is better than the category “Very good,” which is better than the category “Good,” etc. There is some natural ordering, but it is limited since we do not know by how much “Excellent” behaviour is better than “Very good” behaviour.

## Numeric variables
A numeric variable (also called quantitative variable) is a quantifiable characteristic whose values are numbers (except numbers which are codes standing up for categories). Numeric variables may be either continuous or discrete.

### Continuous variables
A variable is said to be continuous if it can assume an infinite number of real values within a given interval. The values of a continuous variable are measured. A continuous variable is a variable that takes on any value within a range, and the number of possible values within that range is infinite.

For instance, consider the height of a student. The height can’t take any values. It can’t be negative and it can’t be higher than three metres.

But between 0 and 3, the number of possible values is theoretically infinite. A student may be 1.6321748755 … metres tall. In practice, the methods used and the accuracy of the measurement instrument will restrict the precision of the variable. The reported height would be rounded to the nearest centimetre, so it would be 1.63 metres. The age is another example of a continuous variable that is typically rounded down.

- The time it takes for office employees to commute to work
- The distance you walk in a day
- The weight of newborn babies

### Discrete variables
a discrete variable can assume only a finite number of real values within a given interval.
Discrete variables have values that are counted.	

Example of a discrete variable is the number of people in a household for a household of size 4 or less

- number of Students in a class
- The number of workers in an office
- The number of steps you take in a day
- The number of babies born each day
