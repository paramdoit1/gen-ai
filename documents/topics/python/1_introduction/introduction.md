# Introduction to Python:
## Overview:
Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and analyze data. Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.

## Python Features:
* `Python is Interpreted` − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
* `Python is Interactive` − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
* `Python is Object-Oriented` − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
* `Python is a Beginner's Language` − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
* It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.
* It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.
* It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
* It supports automatic garbage collection.

## Why Python?
* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some * other programming languages.
* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

## Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
* Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
